# Classifying cat vs non-cat using an L-layer neural network

**Model architecture**: input -> [linear -> relu] x (L-1) -> linear -> sigmoid -> output

* Final assignment for Coursera's [**Neural Networks and Deep Learning**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning)

* Functions and model can be re-purposed for later use

# Main contents

* [Utils file](./dnn_app_utils_v3.py) contains helper functions (forward prop, cost function, backprop)

* [Notebook](./NN%20classifier.ipynb) contains model
